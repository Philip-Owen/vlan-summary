Takes output from Cisco 'show vlan brief | i active' command, strips away unneeded data, and creates a unique list of vlans.

Created because I needed a clean way to view the current vlan configuration and naming conventions for over 20+ switch stacks.

vlans.txt and vlans_sorted.txt are both sanitized examples at a small scale of how this script was used.
